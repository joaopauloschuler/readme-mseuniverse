<short>MSE GUI Component Library</short>
<descr><p>The MSEgui is a set of visual components to create GUI applications for
Window and Linux. No huge toolkits (Qt, Gtk etc.) are required. The OS
included GDI (Windows) and XLib (X Windows on Unix-like systems) are used
to draw widgets. It is tightly bound with FPC, not a Delphi clone but more likely a Delphi redesign and an extention for particular people needs.
