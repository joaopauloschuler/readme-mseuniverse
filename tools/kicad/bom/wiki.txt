# MSEkicadBOM
MSEkicadBOM is a component and footprint database frontend and documents/production file generator application for KiCad.
http://kicad-pcb.org/  
MSEkicadBOM scans the schematic files and extracts the components with their field values. It looks-up the VALUE-, VALUE1- and VALUE2-fields in a component database and selects a footprint library-item based on the settings in the database components and the FOOTPRINTINFO-field.

Currently MSEkicadBOM does what I need, it can be extended if there is enough interest.
